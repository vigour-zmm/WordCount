The Value of Time Nobody knows what time is like  for we cannot see it  nor can we touch it  Time is abstract  which we can only imagine in our mind  But we do know that time passes very quickly  Some students  however  do not know the value of time  nor do they know how to make the best use of it  for they waste it in going to films  playing games and doing other useless things  Why do we go to school early in the morning  Why do trains run so fast  Why do most people prefer taking buses instead of walking  The answer is very simple  we wish to save time because time is precious  Today we are living in the twentieth century  We know that time is life  When a person dies  his time has ended  Since life is short  we must devote our time and energy to our studies so that we may be able to serve our country and the people  But since time is invisible  we often neglect it  Lazinss  is the thief of time  for lasiness not only brings us a lot of harm  it also brings us failure  If it is necessary for us to do some work today  let us do it today and not leave it until tomorrow  Remember that time is more valuable than money
